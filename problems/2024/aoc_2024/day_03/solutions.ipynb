They've never actually had any Chief Historians in stock, but it's best to be prepared.\">in stock</span>! You're welcome to check the warehouse, though,\" says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the <a href=\"/2020/day/2\">North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop</a>. The Historians head out to take a look.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper turns to you. \"Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?\"</p>\n<p>The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is <em>corrupted</em>. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!</p>\n<p>It seems like the goal of the program is just to <em>multiply some numbers</em>. It does that with instructions like <code>mul(X,Y)</code>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, <code>mul(44,46)</code> multiplies <code>44</code> by <code>46</code> to get a result of <code>2024</code>. Similarly, <code>mul(123,4)</code> would multiply <code>123</code> by <code>4</code>.</p>\n<p>However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be <em>ignored</em>, even if they look like part of a <code>mul</code> instruction. Sequences like <code>mul(4*</code>, <code>mul(6,9!</code>, <code>?(12,34)</code>, or <code>mul ( 2 , 4 )</code> do <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:</p>\n<pre><code>x<em>mul(2,4)</em>%&amp;mul[3,7]!@^do_not_<em>mul(5,5)</em>+mul(32,64]then(<em>mul(11,8)mul(8,5)</em>)</code></pre>\n<p>Only the four highlighted sections are real <code>mul</code> instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces <code><em>161</em></code> (<code>2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5</code>).</p>\n<p>Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted <code>mul</code> instructions. <em>What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?</em></p>\n</article>"
